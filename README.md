Load and clean the dataset
Handle missing values
Create time-based and event-based features
Generate rolling statistics and lagged features

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To analyze sales trends, correlations, and anomalies

# Model Training
Training forecasting models 
ARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM

# Model Evaluation
Evaluate models based on:
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
R-Squared Score
